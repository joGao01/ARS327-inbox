- new emails after checking old ones?

- It would be really cool if after opening a certain email, the inbox looked different
- you can't compose mail

This person let work consume their entire life and now it feels like its kind of falling apart, but hey, at least their getting the promotions they want

Super power-hungry?

Inbox:
 all this work related stuff
 networking and making connections

Starred:
 Show their priorities
 
Sent Mail:

Drafts:
 many many unsent emails to his partner and friends
 dates are much older than current date and time

All Mail:


Spam:
 the same email over and over again
 it's a dystopia now bro

Trash:
 Previous emails from his partner
 remnants of the ruined relationship
